# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Project Overview
#### The main purpose of this project is to bring insights regarding production issues with a car prototype that prevent the manufacturing team to move forward. 
#### In this sense, the production data should be reviewed and the following tasks should be accomplished.
+ To performe a multiple linear regression analysis to predict MPG 
+ To generate a statistic summary on suspension coils.
+ To run t-test on suspension coils.
+ To design a statistical study to compare the prototype performance versus other manufacturer vehicles performance. 

#### Additionally a report with the explaination of the findings has been requested.

#### ***Statistical Metrics: p-values***

a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:



Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
a short summary using screenshots from your total_summary and lot_summary dataframes, and address the following question:

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
